The advantage to this layout is that all instruments can be edited and visualized on one screen ‚Äî providing immediate context on how sounds might interact or sync up!</p> <p>This is in contrast to conventional &quot;piano roll&quot; apps, where instruments typically have to be edited one-at-a-time in large, isolated windows.</p> <p>This got me thinking, although the design of &#39;90s trackers was a necessity due to low graphics resolution and lack of mouse input... what if their space-efficient interfaces had an entirely new benefit in the smartphone era?</p> <p>A more &quot;bird&#39;s-eye view&quot; way to precisely edit a song sounds enticing on a phone, where screen space is limited ‚Äî especially so when many iOS music apps feel like an exercise in patience, tiring out my thumbs by poking around on a tiny piano roll that barely fits two octaves (and frequently tapping the wrong note!)</p> <p>That&#39;s why I designed and developed audo: a proof-of-concept tracker for iPhone.</p> <h2>Simply designed for touch</h2> <p>Prior to audo, a few mobile trackers existed, but they felt like scaled-down desktop ports ‚Äî resulting in convoluted control schemes and cluttered menus.</p> <p>audo is exclusively designed around the touchscreen and prioritizes simplification in all aspects of the UX.</p> <p>With each iteration, I challeneged myself to simplify and reduce the number of onscreen elements even further ‚Äî while at the same time, maintaining the same amount of functionality and user efficiency.</p>";return{c(){e=p("section"),n=p("p"),n.textContent=t,o=g(),a=p("p"),a.innerHTML=k,m=g(),r=p("img"),h=g(),l=p("section"),l.innerHTML=x,this.h()},l(i){e=u(i,"SECTION",{});var s=L(e);n=u(s,"P",{"data-svelte-h":!0}),y(n)!=="svelte-1g67vad"&&(n.textContent=t),o=w(s),a=u(s,"P",{"data-svelte-h":!0}),y(a)!=="svelte-19u8hic"&&(a.innerHTML=k),s.forEach(c),m=w(i),r=u(i,"IMG",{class:!0,src:!0,alt:!0}),h=w(i),l=u(i,"SECTION",{"data-svelte-h":!0}),y(l)!=="svelte-190kzjf"&&(l.innerHTML=x),this.h()},h(){q(a,"margin-top","-10px"),q(a,"opacity","0.5"),_(r,"class","bg"),T(r.src,b=W)||_(r,"src",b),_(r,"alt","")},m(i,s){d(i,e,s),v(e,n),v(e,o),v(e,a),d(i,m,s),d(i,r,s),d(i,h,s),d(i,l,s)},p:C,d(i){i&&(c(e),c(m),c(r),c(h),c(l))}}}function N(f){let e,n;return e=new E({props:{logo:O,name:"audo",desc:`reimagining '90s "tracker" music creation for iPhone.`,tools:"Xcode, Swift, UIKit, Affinity Designer, Figma",icon:"üéπ",tags:["ui & ux","app dev"],linkText:"github",linkHref:"https://github.com/jakedel/Audo",date:"2017‚Äâ-‚Äâ18",$$slots:{default:[D]},$$scope:{ctx:f}}}),{c(){P(e.$$.fragment)},l(t){j(e.$$.fragment,t)},m(t,o){A(e,t,o),n=!0},p(t,[o]){const a={};o&1&&(a.$$scope={dirty:o,ctx:t}),e.$set(a)},i(t){n||(H(e.$$.fragment,t),n=!0)},o(t){M(e.$$.fragment,t),n=!1},d(t){z(e,t)}}}class B extends S{constructor(e){super(),I(this,e,null,N,$,{})}}export{B as component};
