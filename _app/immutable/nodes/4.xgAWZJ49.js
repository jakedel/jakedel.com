The advantage to this layout is that all instruments can be edited and visualized on one screen ‚Äî providing immediate context on how sounds might interact or sync up!</p> <p>This is in contrast to conventional &quot;piano roll&quot; apps, where instruments typically have to be edited one-at-a-time in large, isolated windows.</p> <p>This got me thinking, although the design of &#39;90s trackers was a necessity due to low graphics resolution and lack of mouse input... what if their space-efficient interfaces had an entirely new benefit in the smartphone era?</p> <p>A more &quot;bird&#39;s-eye view&quot; way to precisely edit a song sounds enticing on a phone, where screen space is limited ‚Äî especially so when many iOS music apps feel like an exercise in patience, tiring out my thumbs by poking around on a tiny piano roll that barely fits two octaves (and frequently tapping the wrong note!)</p> <p>That&#39;s why I designed and developed audo: a proof-of-concept tracker for iPhone.</p> <h2>Simply designed for touch</h2> <p>Prior to audo, a few mobile trackers existed, but they felt like scaled-down desktop ports ‚Äî resulting in convoluted control schemes and cluttered menus.</p> <p>audo is exclusively designed around the touchscreen and prioritizes simplification in all aspects of the UX.</p> <p>With each iteration, I challeneged myself to simplify and reduce the number of onscreen elements even further ‚Äî while at the same time, maintaining the same amount of functionality and user efficiency.</p>";return{c(){e=p("img"),t=g(),i=p("section"),s=p("p"),s.textContent=k,f=g(),o=p("p"),o.innerHTML=b,m=g(),l=p("section"),l.innerHTML=x,this.h()},l(n){e=u(n,"IMG",{class:!0,src:!0,alt:!0}),t=y(n),i=u(n,"SECTION",{});var a=z(i);s=u(a,"P",{"data-svelte-h":!0}),w(s)!=="svelte-1g67vad"&&(s.textContent=k),f=y(a),o=u(a,"P",{"data-svelte-h":!0}),w(o)!=="svelte-19u8hic"&&(o.innerHTML=b),a.forEach(c),m=y(n),l=u(n,"SECTION",{"data-svelte-h":!0}),w(l)!=="svelte-190kzjf"&&(l.innerHTML=x),this.h()},h(){_(e,"class","bg"),T(e.src,r=E)||_(e,"src",r),_(e,"alt",""),q(o,"margin-top","-10px"),q(o,"opacity","0.5")},m(n,a){d(n,e,a),d(n,t,a),d(n,i,a),v(i,s),v(i,f),v(i,o),d(n,m,a),d(n,l,a)},p:S,d(n){n&&(c(e),c(t),c(i),c(m),c(l))}}}function D(h){let e,r;return e=new W({props:{logo:O,name:"audo",desc:`reimagining '90s "tracker" music creation for iPhone.`,tools:"Xcode, Swift, UIKit, Affinity Designer, Figma",icon:"üéπ",tags:["ui & ux","app dev"],linkText:"github",linkHref:"https://github.com/jakedel/Audo",date:"2017‚Äâ-‚Äâ18",$$slots:{default:[U]},$$scope:{ctx:h}}}),{c(){P(e.$$.fragment)},l(t){j(e.$$.fragment,t)},m(t,i){A(e,t,i),r=!0},p(t,[i]){const s={};i&1&&(s.$$scope={dirty:i,ctx:t}),e.$set(s)},i(t){r||(H(e.$$.fragment,t),r=!0)},o(t){L(e.$$.fragment,t),r=!1},d(t){M(e,t)}}}class F extends C{constructor(e){super(),I(this,e,null,D,$,{})}}export{F as component};
